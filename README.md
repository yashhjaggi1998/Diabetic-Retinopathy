# Diabetic-Retinopathy

This is a project to detect diabetes using the retinal images of human eye. This software is particularly useful for 2 reasons:
1. Helps detect the disease early and hence provides the patient with an opportunity to prevent loss of vision.
2. It is a painless process to detect the level of diabetes that a patient has.

The dataset used for this project has been accumulate from public sources and a few hospitals from Pune, India. Here, we have made certan changes in the popular models of Convolutional Networks.
